## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. **Configure database**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```
5. **Seed the database (optional)**
    ```bash
    # Seed with sample Japanese language courses
    npm run seed:levels

    # Or seed with complete sample data (users, courses, enrollments, notices, meetings)
    npm run seed:complete
    ```
6. **Start the server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Environment Variables

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/lms_db

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

# Server
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
PORT=3001

# Storage Configuration
STORAGE_TYPE=local  # 'local' or 's3'

# AWS S3 (only needed if STORAGE_TYPE=s3)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
```

## Database Seeding

The LMS comes with seed scripts to populate your database with sample data:

### Available Seed Scripts

#### 1. Japanese Language Courses (`seed:levels`)
Creates the 4 Japanese language courses from the frontend levelData:
- **Beginner** - N5 Level
- **Elementary** - N4 Level
- **Intermediate** - N3 Level
- **Advanced** - N2-N1 Levels

#### 2. Complete Sample Data (`seed:complete`)
Creates a full sample LMS environment including:
- **4 Sample Teachers** with different specializations
- **3 Sample Students** enrolled in courses
- **4 Japanese Language Courses** with teachers assigned
- **Student Enrollments** in courses
- **Sample Notices** (general and course-specific)
- **Sample Meetings** with Google Meet links

### Running Seed Scripts

```bash
# Seed only the Japanese language courses
npm run seed:levels

# Seed complete sample data (recommended for testing)
npm run seed:complete

# Or run all seeds
npm run seed:all
```

### Sample Login Credentials

After running `seed:complete`, you can log in with:

```
Admin: admin@example.com / admin123
Teacher: yuki.sato@example.com / password123
Student: student1@example.com / password123
```

### Seed Script Details

- **Safe to run multiple times** - scripts check for existing data
- **Hashed passwords** - all sample passwords are properly hashed
- **Realistic data** - courses include descriptions and features
- **Relationships maintained** - proper teacher assignments and enrollments

## Storage Configuration

The LMS system supports two storage options:

### Local Storage (Default)
- Files are stored in the `uploads/` directory
- Suitable for development and small-scale deployments
- No additional configuration required

### AWS S3 Storage (Production Recommended)
- Scalable cloud storage with global CDN
- Automatic backup and high availability
- See `AWS_S3_INTEGRATION.md` for detailed setup instructions

To enable S3 storage:
1. Install AWS SDK dependencies
2. Configure AWS credentials and bucket
3. Set `STORAGE_TYPE=s3` in environment variables
4. Uncomment S3 code in `src/routes/materials.ts` and `src/routes/lectures.ts`

## Production Deployment

1. **Build the application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. **Set production environment variables**
3. **Use a production database** (PostgreSQL recommended)
4. **Configure storage** (AWS S3 recommended for production)
5. **Configure reverse proxy** (nginx recommended)
6. **Set up SSL certificate**
7. **Monitor logs and performance**

## API Response Format

All API responses follow this format:

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Operation successful",
  "data": { ... },
  "user": { ... } // For auth endpoints
}
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Error message"
}
```

## Error Handling

The API includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Authentication errors (401)
- Authorization errors (403)
- Validation errors (400)
- Not found errors (404)
- Server errors (500)

## Rate Limiting

Consider implementing rate limiting for:
- Authentication endpoints
- File upload endpoints
- Public registration

## Monitoring & Logging

The system logs:
- All user actions (activity tracking)
- Authentication attempts
- File uploads
- Error conditions
- Performance metrics

## Future Enhancements

- Email notifications
- Payment integration
- Video streaming
- Mobile app API
- Advanced analytics
- Integration with external LMS platforms
